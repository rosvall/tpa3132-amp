2 x 25W amp board
=================

NOT YET TESTED!
---------------

What?
-----
This is going to be a very small, very efficient, and hopefully nice sounding amplifier. It's based on [TI's TPA3132D2](http://www.ti.com/product/tpa3132d2), which is a tiny class D amplifier-in-a-chip. It's the compact version of TPA3116D2.

Actual size!
31mm x 38mm (1.2in x 1.5in)

Why?
----
I'm not entirely satisfied with the available chinese TPA3116D2 based boards, so i've set out to make something a bit "tighter".

How?
----
The .pcb and .sch files can be edited in the gEDA programs, available at http://gpleda.org .

I'm using itead's clearances etc.

This is it so far:

I started out with the TPA3116D2 reference schematic and modified it a bit.

![composite](https://github.com/rosvall/tpa3132-amp/blob/master/tpa3132-amp.pcb.composite.png?raw=true)

That thing there looks wrong...
